*easyHTTP* is a simple server library app created under the direction of [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/) in his *Modern JavaScript from the Beginning* course. The app uses the following technologies:

  * JavaScript ES5
  * JavaScript ES6
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Bootstrap 4

### Description

This app represents a custom AJAX library similar in function to Express, is built with vanilla JS ES5, and refactored into JS ES6. All original and refactored versions of the JS files are stored explicitly in `public/scripts/` for the sake of convenient refactor comparison (contra typical Git procedure). The purpose of the app is twofold: as a JS learning excercise, and as a useful library for other projects.

### Features

The app provides simplified CRUD commands in the associated ES5 `easyhttp.js`, which are then illustrated in the `app.js` file. The refactored ES6 versions are enumerated: i.e., `easyhttp2.js` and `easyhttp3.js`. [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com) is used as our RESTful API for mimicking a server and acquiring data for manipulation. The results are displayed in the console.
